# Plan for Software Project Definition

## Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive methodology for creating detailed software project documentation that enables accurate estimation and clear communication with clients. The process transforms initial client conversations into complete project specifications suitable for implementation.

**Target Audience:** Project Managers, Business Analysts, Functional Analysts

**Key Principles:**
- Start with client conversation as the foundation
- Don't assume information not explicitly provided during discovery
- Internal review checkpoints to ensure completeness before proceeding
- Document decisions and rationale
- Maintain clear distinction between client-provided and inferred information
- Present complete proposal to client only at final stage (Phase 5)
- Integrate with Memory Bank for continuity across sessions

**Important Definitions:**
- **Client** - The person/organization requesting software development
- **User** - The person(s) who will actually use the software
- **Transcript** - The initial conversation record with the client (always the source of truth)

---

## Memory Bank Integration

Since memory resets completely between sessions, maintaining the Memory Bank is critical for project continuity.

### Memory Bank Updates

Update relevant Memory Bank files at each phase completion:

- **projectbrief.md** - Initial setup from Discovery Phase
- **productContext.md** - Updated after Discovery and Speculation phases
- **activeContext.md** - Updated continuously throughout all phases
- **systemPatterns.md** - Updated after Scope Definition and Specification phases
- **techContext.md** - Updated after Specification phase
- **progress.md** - Updated at each validation gate and phase completion

### Integration Points

Each phase should explicitly update:
1. Current work focus in activeContext.md
2. Completion status in progress.md
3. Key decisions and patterns discovered
4. Next steps and pending items

---

## Phase 1: Discovery Phase

**Objective:** Extract all information the client provided without making assumptions.

**Key Rule:** ALWAYS USE the transcript as the base of all decisions. Only document what was explicitly stated or clearly implied by the client.

### Discovery Tasks

#### 1.1 High-Level Definition
- **Action:** Identify and document the generic type/category of software (ERP, CRM, WMS, TMS, etc.)
- **Action:** Create a one-paragraph definition of what is requested
- **Output:** `01_discovery_00_highlevel_definition_v1.md`
- **Memory Bank Update:** Create/update projectbrief.md and productContext.md

#### 1.2 Main Flows Definition
- **Action:** Identify and document all flows the client explicitly mentions
- **Output:** `01_discovery_10_mainflows_definition_v1.md`

#### 1.3 Pain Points
- **Action:** Identify and document all pain points the client identifies
- **Output:** `01_discovery_20_painpoints_v1.md`

#### 1.4 Users Definition
- **Action:** Identify and document all users the client identifies
- **Output:** `01_discovery_30_users_v1.md`

#### 1.5 High-Level Sequence Diagram
- **Action:** Create a sequence diagram illustrating what the client needs
- **Output:** `01_discovery_40_sequence_diagram_v1.md`

#### 1.6 Commercial Software Benchmark
- **Action:** Research existing commercial software in the same domain
- **Purpose:** Identify features and functionalities that are common/expected in this type of software
- **Focus:** What features do they offer? How do they solve similar problems? What patterns are established?
- **NOT:** Selecting software to purchase - we're building custom software
- **Include:** 
  - Product name and link
  - Key features relevant to our project
  - Workflows and patterns they use
  - UI/UX approaches worth considering
  - Functionality gaps we should address
- **Output:** `01_discovery_50_benchmark_v1.md`

#### 1.7 Open Source Research

- **Purpose:** Learn from existing implementations - what features exist, how problems are solved
- **Focus:** What functionality do they provide? What architectural patterns do they use? What can we learn?
- **NOT:** Selecting software to implement - we're building custom software
- **Include:** 
  - Repository link and description
  - Key features and modules
  - Technical approaches and patterns
  - Data models and structures
  - Features worth considering for our custom solution

  - Mobile development experience
  - Development tools and practices (version control, CI/CD, testing)
  - Previous experience with relevant patterns (authentication, audit trails, status management, offline-first, etc.)
  - Team size and composition
  - Areas of strong expertise
  - Technologies the team is learning or willing to adopt
- **Output:** `01_discovery_80_team_capabilities_v1.md`
- **Note:** This information will directly influence recommendations in later phases and ensure technical decisions align with team capabilities

#### 1.10 Comprehensive Feature Wishlist
- **Action:** Create a comprehensive catalog of all potential features for custom development
- **Purpose:** Synthesize all features identified across discovery work into a single reference document
- **Sources:**
  - Client's explicit requests (from transcript)
  - Implied needs (from pain points analysis)
  - Features from commercial software benchmark (73+ features identified)
  - Functionality from open source research
  - Workflow requirements (from main flows)
  - Mandatory requirements (from constraints)
- **Organization:**
  - Features grouped by functional area (Equipment Management, Rental Management, Technical/Maintenance, Stock Management, Financial/Billing, User Interface, etc.)
  - Each feature with brief description
  - Priority indication (Must Have, Should Have, Nice to Have)
  - Source reference (where the need was identified)
- **Focus:** Complete feature catalog to inform future specification and development decisions
- **Output:** `01_discovery_99_featurewishlist_v1.md`
- **Note:** MVP definition, technical architecture, scope boundaries, and implementation roadmap will be addressed in later phases when needed

1. If specification gaps identified → Update Specification artifacts → Increment versions
2. If inconsistencies found → Resolve and update affected artifacts
3. Document all changes in Memory Bank (activeContext.md, techContext.md, progress.md)
4. Once complete → Proceed to Presentation Phase

**Memory Bank Update:** Update techContext.md with final technical decisions, progress.md with checkpoint completion, and activeContext.md with key insights for client presentation

## Change Management Process

**Objective:** Manage scope changes systematically throughout the project lifecycle.

### Change Request Process

#### 1. Change Request Submission
**Template:** `change_management/change_request_template_v1.md`

**Required Information:**
- Change Request ID: CR-[YYYYMMDD]-[###]
- Submitted By:
- Date Submitted:
- Priority: (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
- Affected Phase(s):
- Description of Change:
- Rationale/Business Justification:
- Affected Artifacts:
- Affected User Stories:

#### 2. Impact Assessment
**Process:**
1. Analyze impact on scope
2. Analyze impact on timeline
3. Analyze impact on cost
4. Analyze impact on resources
5. Analyze impact on risk
6. Identify dependencies

**Document:** `change_management/CR-[YYYYMMDD]-[###]_impact_assessment_v1.md`

#### 3. Approval Workflow

**Decision Matrix:**
| Impact Level | Timeline Impact | Cost Impact | Approver |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|----------|
| Low | < 2 days | < 5% | Project Manager |
| Medium | 2-5 days | 5-15% | PM + Client |
| High | > 5 days | > 15% | PM + Client + Budget Owner |
| Critical | Any | Any | All Stakeholders |

#### 4. Implementation
**Process:**
1. Update affected artifacts
2. Increment version numbers
3. Update estimates
4. Update timeline
5. Communicate changes to all stakeholders
6. Update Memory Bank (activeContext.md, progress.md)

**Document:** `change_management/CR-[YYYYMMDD]-[###]_implementation_log_v1.md`

#### 5. Change Log
**Maintain:** `change_management/change_log_v1.md`

**Track:**
- All submitted change requests
- Approval status
- Implementation status
- Impact summary
- Lessons learned

### Version Control Strategy

**When to Increment Versions:**
- **v1 → v2**: After validation gate feedback requiring updates
- **v2 → v3**: After change request implementation
- **vX → vX.1**: Minor corrections/typos (no material changes)

**Artifact Versioning:**
- Always include version in filename: `_v[#].md` or `_v[#].[#].md`
- Keep previous versions in `archive/` folder
- Update version history section in each artifact

---

## File Naming Conventions

### Standard Pattern

```
[phase#]_[phasename]_[sequence#]_[artifactname]_v[version].ext
```

**Components:**
- **phase#**: Two-digit phase number (01, 02, 03, 04, 05)
- **phasename**: Short phase identifier (discovery, speculation, scopedefinition, specification, presentation)
- **sequence#**: Two-digit sequence within phase (00, 10, 20, 30...)
- **artifactname**: Descriptive name using underscores
- **version**: Version number (v1, v2, v1.1, etc.)
- **ext**: File extension (.md, .csv, .html, .pdf, etc.)

### Examples

✅ **Good:**
- `01_discovery_00_highlevel_definition_v1.md`
- `03_scopedefinition_40_estimates_effort_v1.csv`
- `04_specification_10_userstories_v2.md`
- `02_speculation_10_script_01_user_login_v1.md`

❌ **Avoid:**
- `highlevel_definition.md` (no phase/sequence)
- `discovery_definition_1.md` (no sequence number, wrong version format)
- `01-discovery-00-definition.md` (use underscores, not hyphens)

### Special Files

**Internal Review Checkpoints:**
```
internal_checkpoint_0[#]_[phasename]_review_v[version].md
```
Examples:
- `internal_checkpoint_01_discovery_review_v1.md`
- `internal_checkpoint_02_speculation_review_v1.md`
- `internal_checkpoint_03_scopedefinition_review_v1.md`
- `internal_checkpoint_04_specification_review_v1.md`

**Client Approval Gate:**
```
client_approval_gate_[gatename]_v[version].md
```
Example:
- `client_approval_gate_proposal_presentation_v1.md`

**Change Management:**
```
change_management/CR-[YYYYMMDD]-[###]_[description]_v[version].md
change_management/change_log_v[version].md
```

**Memory Bank:**
```
memory-bank/[filename].md
```
(No version numbers in Memory Bank files - they're living documents)

## Best Practices

### Project Management
1. **ALWAYS check and update project_checklist.md** at the start and end of each task
2. **Update checklist when completing any task or milestone**
3. **Review checklist status before starting new work** to ensure proper sequencing
4. **Keep checklist aligned with actual progress** - mark items complete only when fully done
5. **Use checklist to track overall project health** and identify blockers

### Communication
1. **Always ground decisions in the transcript** during Discovery
2. **Clearly mark assumptions** during Speculation
3. **Validate frequently** at each gate
4. **Document everything** - if it's not written, it didn't happen
5. **Use consistent terminology** from the client conversation

### Estimation
1. **Estimate in ranges** (min
